description: Run a pull-request (or issue) queue for an area of alchemy — search GitHub for open PRs/issues matching a criteria (e.g. "cloudflare", "docker", "aws/rds", an author, a label), shortlist the top 10 ordered by ease of fixing, then work through them one at a time: check out, merge main, resolve conflicts, audit tests and JSDoc, run the suites, rewrite the PR description as DX snippets, and stop with a merge-or-close recommendation. Use for "start working on a pull request queue for cloudflare", "PR queue for docker", "triage open PRs for X", "work through the open fix(aws) PRs", "next PR" while a queue is running.

# Pull request queue

This session is a queue. Build the catalog once, then take one PR at a time:
fix it, push it, and ask the user to merge or close it. The user merges; you
never do.

## 1. Build the catalog and shortlist

Turn the user's criteria into a search. An area like `docker` or `cloudflare`
matches conventional-commit scopes (`feat(docker)`, `fix(cloudflare/r2)!`) and
PRs that touch that provider's paths.

```sh
gh pr list --state open --limit 300 --json number,title,author,isDraft,mergeable,additions,deletions,changedFiles,updatedAt,isCrossRepository,maintainerCanModify,headRefName,baseRefName,url \
  > /tmp/pr-queue.json
# scope match: ^\w+!?\((<area>)(/[^)]*)?\)!?:   (case-insensitive)
# path match for anything the title missed:
gh pr view <n> --json files --jq '.files[].path' | grep -i '<Area>/'
```

For issues use `gh issue list --state open --search "<area> in:title,body"`.
Free-form criteria map onto `--author`, `--label`, `--search`. Leave out the
user's own PRs unless asked, and honor any exclusions they give (e.g. "ignore
the container PRs").

Print the **catalog**, grouped by theme when it's large:
`PR (link) | Author | Size | Behind main | What it does | Audit notes`, with
✅/❌ against the standards in
[audit/procedure.md §3](../audit/procedure.md#3-review-the-code). Annotate:

- **stacks** — a PR whose `baseRefName` is another PR's branch
  (`base #N ← child #M`)
- **overlaps** — PRs fixing the same issue or touching the same files; plan a
  merge order and which ones to close
- drafts, and PRs waiting on the author's answer to an earlier question

Then the **shortlist: top 10, easiest first** —
`# | PR (link) | Author | Size | Tests now | Likely work`. Rank by clean merge,
small diff, tests already in the right shape, single concern. Exclude drafts,
PRs waiting on the author, and forks we can't push to
(`maintainerCanModify: false`). PRs needing a test rewrite go on a separate
**rework list**. If fewer than 10 match, say it's the whole list.

Keep the shortlist as a status table (`todo` / `ready → merge?` / `close?` /
`merged` / `closed` / `parked`) and re-print it whenever it changes.

## 2–7. Audit each PR

Work through the shortlist with the per-PR procedure shared with the `audit`
skill, [audit/procedure.md](../audit/procedure.md): check out and merge main,
review the code, update JSDoc, run the tests, push and rewrite the
description, then report and ask. Read it in full before the first PR.

## 8. Keep the queue moving

Follow [audit/procedure.md §8](../audit/procedure.md#8-keep-the-list-moving).
When the shortlist is exhausted, re-run the §1 search for the next 10.
