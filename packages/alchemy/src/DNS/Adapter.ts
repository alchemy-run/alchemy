/**
 * Pluggable DNS for custom domains.
 *
 * A custom domain has two independent halves: the platform that SERVES the
 * hostname (CloudFront, an ALB, API Gateway, a Worker, a Fly App, …) and the
 * DNS host that PUBLISHES its records (Route 53, Cloudflare, Hetzner DNS, …).
 * `domain.dns` names the DNS host.
 *
 * The prop value is a {@link DnsConfig}: plain, serializable data
 * (`{ type: "Cloudflare.DNS", zone?, options? }`) that is safe in any
 * Resource or Platform prop, in state, and across the `alchemy dev` sidecar.
 * Each DNS host contributes:
 *
 * - a data constructor (`Cloudflare.DNS.Adapter()`,
 *   `AWS.Route53.Adapter()`, `Hetzner.DNS.Adapter()`), and
 * - a {@link DnsAdapter} implementation registered with
 *   {@link dnsAdapterLayer} from its own `providers()` layer.
 *
 * A composite (or a Platform's `transformProps` hook) resolves the adapter
 * with {@link resolve} while the stack program is being built, and the
 * adapter DECLARES ordinary record resources of its own cloud. No
 * reconciler ever calls an adapter, so destroy and orphan cleanup work from
 * state alone, and the platform packages never import each other.
