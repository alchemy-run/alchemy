/**
 * Register a durable callback with the current host.
 *
 * Cloudflare Durable Objects supply callback registration on their per-instance
 * RuntimeContext. Register handlers in their inner Effect. Other hosts must
 * implement RuntimeContext.makeCallback; unsupported hosts reject registration.
 * Delivery is at least once: external writes must be idempotent. This API does
 * not make unrelated external operations atomic.
 *
 * ### Registering and Scheduling a Callback
 * **Example:** Schedule typed work from a Durable Object instance
 * ```typescript
 * return Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const onArchive = yield* Alchemy.makeCallback(
 *     "archive",
 *     Effect.fn(function* (payload: { key: string; body: string }) {
 *       yield* archive.put(payload.key, payload.body);
 *     }),
 *   );
 *   return {
 *     save: Effect.fn(function* (id: string, body: string) {
 *       yield* state.storage.transaction(
 *         Effect.gen(function* () {
 *           yield* state.storage.put(id, body);
 *           yield* onArchive.schedule(id, {
 *             after: "30 seconds",
 *             payload: { key: id, body },
 *           });
 *         }),
 *       );
 *     }),
 *   };
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Cancelling or Replacing a Job
 * **Example:** Use a stable ID within a callback
 * ```typescript
 * yield* onArchive.schedule("revision-42", {
 *   at: new Date("2026-10-01T09:00:00Z"),
 *   payload: { key: "42.txt", body: "hello" },
 * });
 * yield* onArchive.cancel("revision-42");
 * ```
 *
 * ### Inspecting and Recovering Work
 * **Example:** Resume a parked job from an incoming recovery request
 * ```typescript
 * const status = yield* onArchive.getStatus("revision-42");
 * if (status?.parked) {
 *   yield* onArchive.schedule("revision-42", {
 *     after: 0,
 *     payload: { key: "42.txt", body: "hello" },
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Cloudflare persists an exponential retry budget before each attempt. The
 * default initial delay is 30 seconds, with a one-second minimum. After eight
 * attempts without progress, jobs remain stored and recover hourly. Configure
 * `retry.delay`, `retry.maxAttempts`, and `retry.parkedDelay` when registering.
 * Status preserves the requested `scheduledAt` separately from `retryAt`.
 *
 * Scheduling inside a callback inherits its budget, including when cancelling
 * or changing IDs. Supply a strictly increasing `progress` cursor alongside
 * committed application state to reset it. An external schedule without a
 * cursor starts a fresh budget; stale external cursors leave existing work
 * unchanged. Detached callback fibers cannot schedule or cancel after the
 * invocation ends. Successful completion and cancellation remove the job.
 *
 * Callback names identify persisted jobs; retain handlers for old names while
 * jobs are pending. Payloads must be JSON values compatible with pending jobs
 * from earlier deployments; TypeScript types do not perform runtime decoding.
 * Cloudflare commits scheduling alongside SQLite, KV, and native alarm writes
 * inside the same Durable Object's storage transaction. Automatic recovery from
 * instance termination relies on Cloudflare's native alarm retries. Calling
 * `state.abort` with `{ retryAlarm: false }` removes that recovery guarantee:
 * pending jobs remain stored, but may need an explicitly rearmed native alarm.
 * Other implementations must document their own transaction integration.
