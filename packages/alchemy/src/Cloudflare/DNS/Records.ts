/**
 * A dynamic set of identically-configured Cloudflare DNS records that differ
 * only by name — the Cloudflare counterpart of `AWS.Route53.Records`.
 *
 * Unlike `Cloudflare.DNS.Record` (one resource per record), `Records`
 * reconciles a whole name set against the zone: names added to the set are
 * created or overwritten, names removed from the set are deleted. The set is
 * the union of the declared `names` prop and names contributed through the
 * {@link RecordsBinding} binding contract, which is how composites (e.g. a
 * site attached to an `AWS.Website.Router`) register hostnames on a
 * distribution's DNS without a circular input prop.
 *
 * Ownership: an existing record at a managed `(name, type)` is overwritten
 * (like a Route 53 `UPSERT`) — unlike `Cloudflare.DNS.Record`, which
 * refuses to take over an existing record without `--adopt` — and removed
 * again when the name leaves the set or the set is destroyed. Cloudflare
 * rejects a `CNAME` at a name that already has `A`/`AAAA` records; remove
 * those first.
 * ### Managing Record Sets
 * **Example:** CNAMEs For Several Hostnames
 * ```typescript
 * const records = yield* Cloudflare.DNS.Records("AliasRecords", {
 *   type: "CNAME",
 *   content: distribution.domainName,
 *   names: ["www.example.com", "docs.example.com"],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * **Example:** Binding Target For Composite-Contributed Names
 * ```typescript
 * // An empty set that attached sites bind their hostnames onto:
 * const records = yield* Cloudflare.DNS.Records("SiteAliasRecords", {
 *   zone: "example.com",
 *   type: "CNAME",
 *   content: distribution.domainName,
 * });
 * // elsewhere:
 * yield* records.bind`MySite`({ names: ["docs.example.com"] });
 * ```

 * @product DNS
 * @category Domains & DNS
