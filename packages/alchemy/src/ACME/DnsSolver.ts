/**
 * DNS-01 solvers: how the ACME flow publishes `_acme-challenge` TXT
 * records.
 *
 * A solver has two forms:
 *
 * - a **descriptor** — plain, serializable data in a resource's props
 *   (`{ type: "Cloudflare.DNS", zoneId }`) that survives state and the RPC
 *   boundary. Each DNS provider contributes a constructor
 *   (`Cloudflare.DNS.acmeSolver(zone)`) and registers the matching
 *   implementation from its `providers()` layer, so the ACME provider
 *   never imports a DNS SDK itself.
 * - a **runtime solver** — the {@link DnsSolver} interface a running
 *   Worker or Service hands to `IssueCertificate.issue`, built from a
 *   runtime DNS write client (`Cloudflare.DNS.acmeDnsSolver(dns)`).
