Alchemy is a simple TypeScript script that you run to deploy infrastructure. All you need is a Node.js runtime and a Cloudflare account to get started.

<Steps>

1. **Create your project**

   Start by creating a new project and installing Alchemy.

   ```sh
   mkdir my-alchemy-app
   cd my-alchemy-app
   bun init -y
   bun add alchemy
   bun add -g wrangler
   ```

2. **Login to Cloudflare**

   Authenticate with your Cloudflare account.

   ```sh
   wrangler login
   ```

   :::tip
   Make sure you have a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) (free tier works)
   :::

3. **Create your infrastructure**

   Create `alchemy.run.ts` with a simple Worker:

   ```typescript
   import alchemy from "alchemy";
   import { Worker } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

   const app = await alchemy("my-first-app");

   const worker = await Worker("hello-worker", {
     entrypoint: "./src/worker.ts",
   });

   console.log(`Worker deployed at: ${worker.url}`);
   await app.finalize();
   ```

4. **Create your worker code**

   Create `src/worker.ts`:

   ```typescript
   export default {
     async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
       return Response.json({
         message: "Hello from Alchemy!",
         timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
       });
     },
   };
   ```

5. **Start development mode**

   Run with `--watch` for hot reloading during development:

   ```sh
   bun --watch ./alchemy.run.ts
   ```

   Your worker will be available locally with live updates as you edit your code.

6. **Make a change**

   Update your worker message in `src/worker.ts`:

   ```typescript
   message: "Hello from Alchemy! ðŸ§ª",
   ```

   Save the file and see the change reflected immediately.

7. **Deploy to production**

   Remove `--watch` to deploy to Cloudflare:

   ```sh
   bun ./alchemy.run.ts
   ```

   Visit the URL to see your worker live on Cloudflare's edge network.

8. **Tear down**

   Clean up all resources when you're done:

   ```sh
   bun ./alchemy.run.ts --destroy
   ```
