import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Set up preview deployments and continuous integration for your Alchemy projects using GitHub Actions.

As part of this guide, we'll:
1. Add a Github Workflow to deploy your `prod` stage from the `main` branch
2. Deploy a preview `pr-<number>` stage for each Pull Request
3. Update your `alchemy.run.ts` script to add a Github Comment to the PR with the preview URL

<Steps>

1. **Configure environment variables**

   Set up required secrets in your GitHub repository settings (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions):

   ```bash
   ALCHEMY_PASSWORD=your-encryption-password
   ALCHEMY_STATE_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-api-token
   CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-api-token
   CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL=your-cloudflare-email
   ```

   :::tip
   1. See the [Cloudflare Auth Guide](/guides/cloudflare) if you don't have a `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
   2. See the [Cloudflare State Store Guide](/guides/cloudflare-state-store) if you don't have a `ALCHEMY_STATE_TOKEN`
   :::

2. **Create deployment workflow**

   Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with a workflow for deploying your `prod` stage from the `main` branch and a preview `pr-<number>` stage for each Pull Request:

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy Application
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
     pull_request:
       types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, closed]
   
   concurrency:
     group: "deploy-${{ github.ref }}"
     cancel-in-progress: false

   env:
     STAGE: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'prod' || format('pr-{0}', github.event.number) }}
   
   jobs:
     deploy:
       # only deploy for open PRs
       if: ${{ github.event.action != 'closed' }}
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       permissions:
         contents: read
         pull-requests: write
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
   
         - name: Setup Bun
           uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
   
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: bun install
   
         - name: Deploy
           run: bun alchemy deploy --stage ${{ env.STAGE }}
           env:
             ALCHEMY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.ALCHEMY_PASSWORD }}
             ALCHEMY_STATE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ALCHEMY_STATE_TOKEN }}
             CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
             CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL }}
             PULL_REQUEST: ${{ github.event.number }}
             GITHUB_SHA: ${{ github.sha }}
     cleanup:
       # cleanup when the PR is closed
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       if: ${{ github.event.action == 'closed' && github.ref != 'refs/heads/main' }}
       permissions:
         id-token: write
         contents: read
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4

         - name: Setup Bun
           uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
   
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: bun install
   
         - name: Destroy Preview Environment
           run: bun alchemy destroy --stage ${{ env.STAGE }}
           env:
             ALCHEMY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.ALCHEMY_PASSWORD }}
             ALCHEMY_STATE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ALCHEMY_STATE_TOKEN }}
             CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
             CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL }}
             PULL_REQUEST: ${{ github.event.number }}
   ```

3. **Set up preview environments in your Alchemy script**

   Update your `alchemy.run.ts` to support multiple stages, use the [CloudflareStateStore](/guides/cloudflare-state-store) and add a [GithubComment](/providers/github/comment) to the PR with the preview URL:

   ```diff lang='ts'
   import alchemy from "alchemy";
   import { Worker, Vite } from "alchemy/cloudflare";
   import { GitHubComment } from "alchemy/github";
   import { CloudflareStateStore } from "alchemy/state";
   
   const app = await alchemy("my-app", {
   +  stateStore: (scope) => new CloudflareStateStore(scope),
   });
   
   // your website may be different, we use Vite for illustration purposes
   const website = await Vite("website", {
     // publish a version of the Website's Worker if this is a non-prod stage
   +  version: app.stage === "prod" ? undefined : app.stage,
   });
   
   console.log(`üöÄ Deployed to: https://${website.url}`);

   +if (process.env.PULL_REQUEST) {
   +  // if this is a PR, add a comment to the PR with the preview URL
   +  // it will auto-update with each push
   +  await GitHubComment("preview-comment", {
   +    owner: "your-username",
   +    repository: "your-repo",
   +    issueNumber: Number(process.env.PULL_REQUEST),
   +    body: `
   +     ## üöÄ Preview Deployed
   +
   +     Your changes have been deployed to a preview environment:
   +
   +     **üåê Website:** ${website.url}
   +
   +     Built from commit ${process.env.GITHUB_SHA?.slice(0, 7)}
   +
   +     ---
   +     <sub>ü§ñ This comment updates automatically with each push.</sub>`,
   +  });
   +}
   
   await app.finalize();
   ```

</Steps>
