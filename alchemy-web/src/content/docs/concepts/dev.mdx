Alchemy's development mode provides a local development experience for Cloudflare Workers, featuring hot reloading, local resource emulation, and seamless integration with remote Cloudflare services.

:::caution
Development mode is currently in beta. Some features may not work as expected.
:::

## Overview

To run Alchemy in development mode, use the [`alchemy dev`](/concepts/cli#dev) command to:

- Emulate Cloudflare Workers and associated resources locally using Miniflare
- Watch for and auto-apply changes to your infrastructure
- Hot reload Workers when you make changes to your runtime code

    You can also specify additional options:

    ```bash
    # run dev mode with default settings
    bun alchemy dev

    # specify a stage
    bun alchemy dev --stage dev

    # use a custom script
    bun alchemy dev ./my-infra.ts

    # use an environment file
    bun alchemy dev --env-file .env.dev

## Configuration

When running in dev mode, Alchemy runs your Cloudflare Workers locally using Miniflare, and will be available on a randomly selected port. You can specify the port by setting the `port` property on the `Worker` resource:

```typescript
const worker = await Worker("my-worker", {
  entrypoint: "worker.ts",
  dev: {
    port: 3000,
  },
});

console.log(worker.url); // http://localhost:3000
```

## Website Development

When using the `Website` resource in development mode, you can specify a custom development command that Alchemy will run locally:

```typescript
const website = await Website("my-website", {
  dev: {
    command: "npm run dev",
    url: "http://localhost:5173",
  },
});
```

If no command is specified, Alchemy will automatically detect and run the appropriate dev command based on your project's configuration. For example, for a Vite project, it will run:

```bash
vite dev
```

## Vite Integration

For projects using Vite, Alchemy integrates with the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/development-testing/vite/) to provide enhanced local development capabilities. This integration enables better support for certain binding types when running locally.

To enable Vite integration, configure your `vite.config.ts` with the Cloudflare plugin:

```typescript
import { cloudflare } from "@cloudflare/vite-plugin";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    cloudflare({
      persistState: process.env.ALCHEMY_CLOUDFLARE_PERSIST_PATH
        ? {
            path: process.env.ALCHEMY_CLOUDFLARE_PERSIST_PATH,
          }
        : undefined,
    }),
  ],
});
```

The Vite integration provides improved support for the following binding types (marked with âœ… in the "Vite" column of the supported resources table below).

## Bindings

By default, Alchemy emulates resources such as [D1 Databases](/providers/cloudflare/d1-database), [KV Namespaces](/providers/cloudflare/kv-namespace), and [R2 Buckets](/providers/cloudflare/bucket) locally.

Alchemy also supports [remote bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings) for select resources. For resources that allow either local or remote execution, you can set the `dev` property on the resource to `{ remote: true }`:

```typescript
const db = await D1Database("my-db", {
  dev: { remote: true },
});

const kv = await KVNamespace("my-kv", {
  dev: { remote: true },
});

const r2 = await R2Bucket("my-r2", {
  dev: { remote: true },
});
```

Some resources only support remote execution, such as [AI Gateways](/providers/cloudflare/ai-gateway). These resources will automatically be run remotely, so usage will be billed the same as if you were running them in production.

## Limitations

:::caution
- Local Workers can push to remote queues, but cannot consume from them.
- Hyperdrive support is experimental. Hyperdrive configurations that use Cloudflare Access are not supported, and only configurations provisioned in the same `alchemy.run.ts` file will work. This is a [limitation from Cloudflare that is actively being worked on](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/development-testing/#unsupported-remote-bindings).
- Container bindings with `dev: { remote: true }` cannot be used as local bindings in development mode.
- You may see "Connection refused" errors in the console when containers are starting up - these can be safely ignored.
