You can store your configuration settings and cloud provider credentials in organized profiles managed by the Alchemy CLI.

Profiles allow you to maintain separate sets of credentials for different environments or projects. By default, Alchemy uses the `default` profile, but you can create and switch between multiple profiles as needed.

Individual profile settings can be overridden using environment variables or command line flags.

You can use the `alchemy configure`, `alchemy login`, and `alchemy logout` commands with the `--profile` flag to create, login to, and logout from a profile.

## Format of the configuration and credential files

The config and credentials files are organized into profiles. A profile is a named collection of settings for cloud providers. Multiple profiles can be stored in the configuration system.

These files are JSON files that use the following format:

- Profile names are stored as object keys in the `profiles` object
- All entries in a profile take the form of `"setting_name": "value"`
- The configuration and credentials files contain profile and provider settings

The config and credentials files contain the following types:

- **Configuration**: Provider metadata and authentication methods
- **Credentials**: Sensitive authentication data stored separately

### Configuration file format

The configuration file stores provider metadata and authentication methods:

**Config file** (`~/.alchemy/config.json`):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "profiles": {
    "default": {
      "cloudflare": {
        "method": "oauth",
        "metadata": {
          "id": "<account-id>",
          "name": "<account-name>"
        },
        "scopes": [
          "account:read",
          "user:read",
          "workers:write"
        ]
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "cloudflare": {
        "method": "api-token",
        "metadata": {
          "id": "<account-id>",
          "name": "<account-name>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Credentials file format

Sensitive credentials are stored separately in provider-specific files in `~/.alchemy/credentials/<profile>/<provider>.json`:


## Using Profiles with Environment Variables

You can reference profiles using environment variables instead of passing the `--profile` flag to alchemy commands:

### ALCHEMY_PROFILE

Set the `ALCHEMY_PROFILE` environment variable to specify which profile to use for all Alchemy operations:

```bash
export ALCHEMY_PROFILE=production
alchemy deploy  # Uses the 'production' profile
```

### CLOUDFLARE_PROFILE

Set the `CLOUDFLARE_PROFILE` environment variable to specify which profile to use specifically for Cloudflare credentials:

```bash
export CLOUDFLARE_PROFILE=my-cloudflare-profile
alchemy deploy  # Uses Cloudflare credentials from 'my-cloudflare-profile'
```

This is useful when you want to use different profiles for different cloud providers within the same deployment.
