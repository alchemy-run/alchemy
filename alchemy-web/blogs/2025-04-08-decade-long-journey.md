A post on my decade long journey with Infrastructure-as-Code, why I built my own minimal library in pure TypeScript and why I think you should at least entertain the idea of "un-bundling IaC" and returning to simplicity.

I built alchemy after years of working with every other option, from CloudFormation, CDK, to Pulumi, Terraform and Kubernetes. IaC is non-negotiable in my opinion, and is one of my favorite technologies as a developer.

I started with CloudFormation since I worked at Amazon and really hated that. JSON is just not expressive enough for me and debugging broken stacks was was always something I dreaded. I'm pretty sure the CFN website still squashes the whole error message into a 10 pixel wide box ðŸ˜….

The CDK is an upgrade on that (because yay for TypeScript) but it is still always going to be limited by the CloudFormation service, which is very slow to change and use.

Being developed by corporate giant Amazon and with the founder moved on to new ideas, you just have to accept that things will move more slowly and you have no say or control over that. It's how things are in a big centralized company.

One mega wart with the CDK technically is its awful coupling to synchronous I/O, making it damn near impossible to do anything async. Every user inevitably runs into this, googles it and is met with "fuck off" in the GitHub issues. Then we're forced to hack around it, which is not pretty. Not allowing is async is basically not allowing JavaScript. I doubt it'll ever be fixed.

They're also stuck on CJS. Taking a dependency on the CDK and using it anywhere other than locally will 10x the size of your app and destroy your DX. It's a tangled mess of of complicated, legacy TypeScript code generating complicated, proprietary JSON files uploaded to the complicated, opaque, proprietary CloudFormation service ðŸ« 

Why? How does this serve the user?

Later, I moved on to Pulumi, which was a nice change of pace since it runs locally and is much faster. You can cancel a deployment by hitting Ctrl+C (hallelujah!) and it also supports more than just AWS, which is great because everything should be managed sensibly in code.

However, Pulumi is largely a wrapper around Terraform. If you thought you were going to escape the layers, you were sorely mistaken. That JavaScript is just lipstick on the pig that are clunky "providers" implemented with Go, running in a separate process. You can't just run Pulumi everywhere (like the browser) and it even struggles to run in AWS Lambda if you're using ESM.

Pulumi Custom Resources are possible but more of an afterthought and a PITA to implement. They have many sharp edges and gotchas, like the resource code having to be serialized and their coupling to CJS - so if you import the wrong thing with ESM, it just breaks. I couldn't even use AWS SDK v3 in a simple custom resource because of how leaky these hacks are.

If Pulumi bricks itself by getting into some weird state, good luck fixing it. Their state files are complicated and their providers are opaque, so you're really just stuck running `pulumi refresh` and praying, or surgically removing and restoring resources one by one. It's not transparent.

I've used Terraform when I've been forced into it. It does exactly what it claims to do, but I don't love it because it's a custom DSL and a heavy toolchain. And for what? Calling a few CRUD APIs? Way overkill.

If it doesn't already exist in Terraform, then just forget it. Every time I think about implementing a custom resource for Terraform, I just can't bring myself to do it. Let me just write a function in my language, please! 

Lately, I've been using SST because I've been doing a ton of web development. At first, I really liked SST because of its local development experience. `sst dev` gives you live deploy, a TUI multiplexer and a proxy from the cloud to your local code. This is great for building web apps in AWS.

But, SST is a wrapper around Pulumi!! (which is a wrapper around terraform (which is a wrapper around the underlying SDK ( ... ( ... ( ... )))) ...

Layers. Layers. Layers. When will it ever end?

As my app grew, SST's bugs and opinions ate away at me. I got blocked by broken resources that have race conditions and it was impossible to work around (still is, by the way). I also wanted to deploy a nested app using another `sst.config.ts` but it conflicted with their assumptions around generated sst-env.d.ts files.

Again, I was let down by the complexity and opinions(!) of my chosen IaC framework. And for what? To help me call a few CRUD APIs and track my Resources?

Honestly, it just seems insane how far we've drifted away from simplicity in this area. This became even more apparent as I started using Cursor more and more to write code.

You see, I've found myself doing more frontend than I've ever done before, and I'm not a good frontend developer. So, I relied on Cursor to write most of the code for me and (as many others have experienced) it totally blew my mind ðŸ¤¯

Cursor is just really, really, really good at TypeScript, React and Tailwind. I've built a functioning and (if i don't say so myself) good looking SPA. It's been a blast. As a "backend guy", i feel my world has opened up.

But, this got me thinking ... you know what else Cursor is really great at? Perhaps even better at?

ðŸ‘‰ Interacting with CRUD APIs.

While there's a ton of frontend training data for LLMs, there's just as much (if not more) training data for CRUD lifecycle operations. They've also ingested all of Kubernetes, Terraform, Pulumi, SST and the AWS CDK's training data. Modern LLMs know it very well.

Long story short, I discovered that Cursor can pretty much one-shot the implementation of Resources. All of the resources in Alchemy are entirely generated on-demand (5 minute time investment, tops). When I run into a bug, I just explain it to Cursor who fixes it immediately.

Working this way may seem like more work at first glance, but in practice I think it's not. I will never get blocked by working this way. I will never have to wait for another person to prioritize my problem, merge a fix and release the change. I will never be confused about what's actually happening under the covers.

This is a game changer for me. It means we don't need tools like Terraform to build layers of "provider" suites for us. We just need the engine - the bit that tracks state and decides what to create/update/delete. The rest can be generated at near zero cost.

I suspect a lot of people gripe with me on this claim of "zero cost" because they have not yet embraced the AI-generation workflow. Their instinct is right, but outdated.

Before LLMs, I would agree that this was infeasible, but I think we've finally crossed the threshold where LLMs can do this work trivially and respond in real-time to your requirements.

If this is not obvious to you, then I suggest forcing yourself to practice with AI code generation. When it fucks up, try blaming yourself instead of blaming and discarding the LLM. I think you're missing a skill.

This is why adoption curves are a thing, do you want to be a laggard?

At the end of the day, you need to realize that agency is going to matter more and more as time progresses and that shackling yourself to a mega-provider who doesn't even know your name is a ticket to inefficiency.

I think we've mostly been hoodwinked into thinking that because managing infrastructure is complicated, we need complicated solutions. Now is the time for that pendulum to swing back in the other direction and "un-bundle" IaC.
