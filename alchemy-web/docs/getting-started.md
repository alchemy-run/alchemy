# Getting Started with Alchemy

Alchemy is an embeddable, zero-dependency, TypeScript-native Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) library for modeling resources that are created, updated, and deleted automatically. Unlike similar tools like Pulumi, Terraform, and CloudFormation, Alchemy is implemented in pure ESM-native TypeScript code with zero dependencies.

## Installation

To get started with Alchemy, you need to install it using your preferred JavaScript runtime. We recommend using Bun for its performance and simplicity.
