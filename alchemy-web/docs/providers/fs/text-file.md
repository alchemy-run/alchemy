# Text File

The Text File resource allows you to create and manage plain text files in the filesystem using Alchemy. This resource is part of the Alchemy Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) library, which is designed to model resources that are created, updated, and deleted automatically. For more information about Alchemy, visit the [Alchemy GitHub repository](https://github.com/alchemy).

# Minimal Example

```ts
import { TextFile } from "alchemy/fs";

// Create a simple text file with content
const readme = await TextFile("README.md", "# Project Name\n\nProject description goes here.");
```

# Create the Text File

```ts
import { TextFile } from "alchemy/fs";

// Create a text file with specific content
const notes = await TextFile("notes.txt", "These are some important notes.");
```

This example demonstrates how to create a text file named `notes.txt` with specified content using the Text File resource in Alchemy.
