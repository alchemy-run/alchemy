# React Router

This guide demonstrates how to deploy a [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) (formerly Remix.js) application to Cloudflare with Alchemy.

## Create a new React Router Project

Start by creating a new React Router project using Alchemy:

::: code-group

```sh [bun]
bunx alchemy create my-react-router-app --template=react-router
cd my-react-router-app
```

```sh [npm]
npx alchemy create my-react-router-app --template=react-router
cd my-react-router-app
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm dlx alchemy create my-react-router-app --template=react-router
cd my-react-router-app
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn dlx alchemy create my-react-router-app --template=react-router
cd my-react-router-app
```

:::

The CLI will automatically:

- Create a new React Router project using the Cloudflare template
- Install all required dependencies including `alchemy` and `@cloudflare/workers-types`
- Configure the project for Cloudflare Workers deployment
- Generate the deployment configuration with proper TypeScript setup

> [!NOTE]
> This template is based on Cloudflare's React Router template but adapted to work with Alchemy instead of wrangler.

## Explore the Generated Files

Let's explore the key files that were created for you:

### Deployment Configuration

The `alchemy.run.ts` file contains your infrastructure setup:

```typescript
/// <reference types="@types/node" />

import alchemy from "alchemy";
import { ReactRouter } from "alchemy/cloudflare";

const app = await alchemy("my-react-router-app");

export const worker = await ReactRouter("website", {
  main: "./workers/app.ts",
  command: "bun run build",
});

console.log({
  url: worker.url,
});

await app.finalize();
```

### Type Definitions

The `types/env.d.ts` file provides type-safe access to Cloudflare bindings:

```typescript
// This file infers types for the cloudflare:workers environment from your Alchemy Worker.
// @see https://alchemy.run/docs/concepts/bindings.html#type-safe-bindings

import type { worker } from "../alchemy.run.ts";

export type CloudflareEnv = typeof worker.Env;

declare global {
  type Env = CloudflareEnv;
}

declare module "cloudflare:workers" {
  namespace Cloudflare {
    export interface Env extends CloudflareEnv {}
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Configuration

The CLI updated the `tsconfig.json` to include proper Cloudflare types:

```json
{
  "files": [],
  "references": [
    { "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" },
    { "path": "./tsconfig.cloudflare.json" }
  ],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "checkJs": true,
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "types": ["@cloudflare/workers-types", "./types/env.d.ts"]
  }
}
```

The CLI also modified the `tsconfig.node.json` to exclude unnecessary files and properly reference the types.

## Log in to Cloudflare

Before you can deploy, you need to authenticate by running `wrangler login`.

::: code-group

```sh [bun]
bun wrangler login
```

```sh [npm]
npx wrangler login
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm wrangler login
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn wrangler login
```

:::

> [!TIP]
> Alchemy will by default try and use your wrangler OAuth token and Refresh Token to connect but see the [Cloudflare Auth](../guides/cloudflare-auth.md) for other methods.

## Deploy

Now we can run and deploy our Alchemy stack:

::: code-group

```sh [bun]
bun run deploy
```

```sh [npm]
npm run deploy
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm run deploy
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn run deploy
```

:::

It will log out the URL of your new React Router website hosted on Cloudflare:

```
{
  url: "https://website.${your-sub-domain}.workers.dev",
}
```

## Local Development

To run your application locally:

::: code-group

```sh [bun]
bun run dev
```

```sh [npm]
npm run dev
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm run dev
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn run dev
```

:::

## Destroy

For illustrative purposes, let's destroy the Alchemy stack:

::: code-group

```sh [bun]
bun run destroy
```

```sh [npm]
npm run destroy
```

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm run destroy
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn run destroy
```

You're done! Happy React-Router'ing ðŸ˜Ž
